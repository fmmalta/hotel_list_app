# Security Implementation Documentation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Hotel List App to ensure secure API communication and data protection.

## API Communication Security

### 1. Secure Transport Layer

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All API communications are enforced to use HTTPS in staging and production environments.
- **Cookie Security**: Using cookie_jar and dio_cookie_manager for secure cookie handling.

### 2. Authentication and Authorization

- **Token-based Authentication**: JWT tokens are securely stored using flutter_secure_storage.
- **Token Refresh**: Automatic handling of token expiration with refresh mechanisms.
- **API Key Authentication**: Separate API keys for each environment (development, staging, production).

### 3. Request/Response Security

- **Request Sanitization**: All outgoing request data is sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
- **Security Headers**: Adding security headers like X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and X-XSS-Protection.

### 4. Implementation Components

- **SecureApiClient**: Centralizes security implementation for API communication.
- **APIService**: Uses the SecureApiClient to ensure all API requests are secure.

## Secure Storage

- **Encrypted Storage**: flutter_secure_storage is used for storing sensitive information like tokens.
- **Environment-specific Settings**: Different security settings for development, staging, and production environments.
